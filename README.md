 Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. It was invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s and 1840s as a means of transmitting messages across long distances via telegraph wires. Morse code assigns a unique combination of dots and dashes to each letter, numeral, and punctuation mark of the English alphabet. For example, the letter "A" is represented by a dot followed by a dash (".-"), "B" by a dash followed by three dots ("-..."), and so on. The system works by transmitting these sequences of dots and dashes as electrical signals through a telegraph wire or as audio signals through sound, with pauses between letters and words to distinguish between characters and words. This allowed for efficient long-distance communication before the advent of modern telecommunications technologies.
